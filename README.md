# scraping-challenge
In this project, data related to Mars was explored and analyzed with a specific focus on temperature and atmospheric pressure readings obtained by NASA's Curiosity rover. Using web scraping techniques, relevant information was extracted from a web page and the date was organized into a structured format using the pandas library. This analysis addressed many questions such as the identification of the number of Martian months, the duration of data collection in Martian days, and the determination of the coldest and warmest months at the Curiosity rover's location. Additionally, the average minimum temperature and atmospheric pressure by Martian month were visualized, providing insights into Mars' seasonal patterns. Web scraping, data manipulation, and visualization in Python were just some of the skills used to contribute to obtaining a deeper understanding of the unique environmental conditions on Mars.
